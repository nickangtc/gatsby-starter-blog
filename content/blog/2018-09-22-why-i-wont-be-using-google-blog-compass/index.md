Google released a product called Google Blog Compass (link broken as Google decommissioned the service; removed) that is supposed to help bloggers know what to write. Sounds like a great idea, right? Now you'll know what to write that people will want to read.

But I think there's something off-putting about this notion that we should write to gain readership, especially if you are a personal blogger writing for fun and not for fame or business.

There are only a few reasons people keep blogs:

- As an indie publishing house, smaller in scale than the New York Times and news networks (eg. Vice, Vox)
- As part of a business strategy to carry out what is now widely known as content marketing, to drive inbound leads to buy stuff on your site
- As space to publicly share one's ideas, thoughts, opinions, and [subjective experiences](/2018-04-02-subjective-experience/) which can be shared with people when desired and, potentially, serve as a logbook of one's life
- As a way to gain hollow follower-ship by pandering to people's attraction to drama and sensational information

Google's new blog compass app may be helpful for people in groups one, two, and especially four. I think I belong to the third group, so it isn't useful to me.

The world is noisy, though, and I've met several people who have presented the idea to me that I should "monetise" my blog by driving up readership with a proper content marketing strategy and selling products or ad space. On at least a few occasions, I've given it serious thought.

But that would potentially rob me of the joy of being able to write to no one in particular when I want to. So you, the reader, would, instead of observing a person having fun in his own little corner of the world, be part of a transaction in this blog.

I'm not sure I want that for this blog, and I hope nobody manages to convince me otherwise.

Also, it seems like at least [TechCrunch thinks the same](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/googles-newest-app-blog-compass-helps-bloggers-in-india-manage-their-sites/) about the futility of chasing trending topics to write about.
