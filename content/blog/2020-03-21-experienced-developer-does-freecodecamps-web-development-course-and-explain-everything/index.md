Hey! I have something exciting to share with you. I recently started to record myself doing the (free) exercises on [freecodecamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org).

The spark for this project came from my wife. She recently asked me to teach her to code, knowing that I have already been teaching many people how to code. My initial reaction was, "Sure, why not!"

Then a second thought quickly followed:

_Why not teach in such a way that she can not only pause and rewind parts of each lesson, but also share easily with her friends (and mine)?_

I have to admit, of course, that part of the motivation to do this is self-indulgence - I have been searching for an excuse to try creating videos.

So, whether you have always been wanting to learn to code and don't know where to start, or you are just cooped up and bored at home because of COVID-19, I think you may find this **tutorial video series** useful.

I chose FreeCodeCamp because it is what I used initially to self-learn programming before I enrolled in a [full-time bootcamp](/2017-03-12-general-assembly-singapore-review/).

Here's the introductory video:
