This is one of those things that is very easy to forget when unused. But I find that it's something worth revisiting now and again because it's so fundamental to how computers work. 

If you don't know binary as an application developer, it wouldn't have a big impact on your ability to do your day to day work. But it may make you feel a little uncertain about what how the underlying files that hold your code are *really* represented by your computer. A big deal? No. Nice to know? Yes!
