New project. Sharing a new technical learning everyday! Inspired by the tenacious artist [@beeple_crap](https://www.beeple-crap.com/).

I explain it in a video (the image above is just a screenshot of what I sketched in that video):

<video controls width="350">

            type="video/mp4">
    Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
