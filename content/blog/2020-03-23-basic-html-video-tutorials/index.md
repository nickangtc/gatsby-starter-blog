This is a group of videos that are part of a bigger series of video walkthroughs. Read [Experienced Developer does FreeCodeCampâ€™s Web Development course](/2020-03-21-experienced-developer-does-freecodecamps-web-development-course-and-explain-everything/) for more details about the video series.

I recently finished recording and publishing 5 video tutorials that cover Basic HTML! I am quite happy with how they turned out and I have decided to continue to record more video tutorials, at least until I complete the Responsive Web Design certificate on [freecodecamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org).

Here are the 5 videos covering Basic HTML:

- [Part 1: Basic Elements + Commenting](https://youtu.be/BtMvxDXdk9A)
- [Part 2: Nesting Elements + Links + Web Accessibility](https://youtu.be/h0yRG6Pkb6E)
- [Part 3: Lists + Forms](https://youtu.be/G_ojmEQJfgk)
- [Part 4: Radio and Checkbox Buttons](https://youtu.be/pjsqLmxkLyI)
- [Part 5: HTML document structure](https://youtu.be/svK0yDKrRnw)

If you like any of the videos, please literally "like" and subscribe for future updates! :)

## Learnings

This was my first foray into creating video tutorials and I learned a number of things:

- **Audio quality matters.** I was using the built-in microphone of my AirPods and Bose headphones, but both were lacklustre upon review. From the 4th video onwards, I started using a Zoom H1n external microphone and it makes watching the video _much_ more pleasant on the ears. Thanks to my colleague Marc who inspired me with his mic setup at home during this coronavirus work-from-home period! (I referred to his [How to record almost like a pro](http://info.momeunier.fr/how-record-almost-pro/) blog post which summarises quick tips on mic setups.)
- **Don't forget your position.** My intent for this series is to _ride on_ freeCodeCamp's open-source curriculum to _teach_ people web development, not to do the exercises for my own learning while explaining on the side. In the first two videos I forgot about this and skipped some explanations (which I ended up supplementing with a comment in the video). As long as I remember that I'm doing this to teach, I won't forget to unpack concepts.
- **Keep the blemishes in.** Since I'm trying to help people learn, I think it's useful to keep my mistakes in the recordings. That's why I don't edit away parts where I stumble. Also, this has the benefit of keeping post-production light so the work doesn't feel so boring to me.

More learnings to come, I'm sure!
