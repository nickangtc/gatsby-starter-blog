I was back today at where all interestingness in my career began - the [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/locations/singapore) campus in Singapore. It sprang up in Singapore from New York 4 years ago and I made my way into its history 3 years ago, fresh from a failed startup, attempting to learn to code.

Today, when someone made the effort to tell me that my [post](https://www.nickang.com/general-assembly-singapore-review/) about General Assembly had helped him decide to enrol in their Web Development course, everything came full circle. I feel happy, glad, and full.

Thanks, Andrew!

You had no real reason to tell me your story and how I was a part of it, but you did. That is a small gesture that changes everything.

I wrote my [review](https://www.nickang.com/general-assembly-singapore-review/) of the General Assembly web development course where I learned to code as a way of giving back to the community of career-switchers and beginner coders.

It was a small act of kindness, inspired by [another person’s](https://jaredtong.com/general-assembly-singapore-review/) small act of kindness as he published the review that helped _me_ feel confident in enrolling in the programming bootcamp.

And I consider Andrew’s sharing with me today another small of act kindness. I believe it is small acts of kindness like these that collectively make our society stronger and more connected. Knowing that I have moved the needle by a tiny millimetre on this front makes me incredibly pleased!
