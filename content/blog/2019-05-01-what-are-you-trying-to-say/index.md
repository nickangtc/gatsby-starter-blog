I want to admit something. Half the time, I don’t really know what I want to say.

Sometimes, it’s because I’m unsure if I care enough about something to actually say something meaningful about it.

Other times, I just draw a blank, as though I’d just been born without a clue about how anything works, let alone having anything useful to say.

Seth Godin’s recent [blog post](https://seths.blog/2019/04/on-finding-something-to-say/) captures this phenomenon very clearly:

> The throughline of the last twenty years of tech has been new ways to speak up and connect. We’ve built platforms for email, video, writing, short fiction, daily updates, chat, discussion, classes… But what if you don’t have anything to say? It’s difficult to find a tech solution for this problem. It might be that instead of spending more time looking for a louder platform, you could profit from digging in and doing the hard work of figuring out the change you seek to make. **If you’re unable to influence one person in a face to face meeting, all the tech in the world isn’t going to help you change a million people** _(emphasis added)_.

That last sentence is like a mirror. It reminds us that telling a good story to move people into action begins with us knowing exactly what changes we want to see.

What changes do you want to see?

I’m still kind of figuring that out for myself. At least now I have an idea of what the target looks like.
