Sweet juicy persimmons. Cut width-wise, reveal an asterisk.

Processed food country. Jamon, cheese, criminal lack of green leafy vegetables.

Two weeklong cough with green phlegm, likely from copious consumption of Ajo Negro cheeses. Slow down next time. Ended up sleeping half the trip in separate beds.

Wonderful lack of sea spray on windows.

Tapas = bar. Restaurants don't serve tapas. Two euro average per tapas.

Tortilla de patatas. Potato omelettes, with or without onions, pick wisely in social situations.

Eight euro splinter removal in polyclinic, zero wait time.

Climbers praise Singapore's social engineering unwittingly in the presence of a Singaporean.

1.30 euros per litre of diesel. Complimentary, happy windscreen wiping service.

Feliz Navidad with a friend's local family. Baked chicken leg stuffed with cheese and jamon. Model cashier with a barcode scanner that goes _beep_, _beep_.

TEDi stationery runsâ€”15 euros for a 60-marker set.

Malaga airport mayhem due to carpark height limit. My fault. Walked from long-term carpark and all was good.

Friendly people. Chatty climbers, generous loaner crashpads.
