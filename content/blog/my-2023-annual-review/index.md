An Annual Review is a personal note that is designed to spark self-reflection about the year that just went by. The goal is to take stock of the year, appreciate the little things, digest the learnings, and apply them in the years to come.

This is my third year writing an Annual Review in this format. You can find my reviews from yesteryears here: [2017](/2017-12-31-new-years-resolution-2018/), [2018](/2018-12-29-my-favourite-posts-from-2018/), [2019](/2019-12-31-goals-for-2020/), [2020](/2020-12-13-my-2020-annual-review/), and [2021](/2022-01-02-my-2021-annual-review/).

In the review, I ask myself three questions:

1. What went well this year?
2. What did not go so well this year?
3. What did I learn this year?

Let's get into each of these in the sections below.

## 1.  What went well this year?

**Consistently acted upon our wishes**. We spent 3 months at the beginning of the year in a rental apartment in the south of Spain because we felt we could have 3 more months of good-living if we temporarily lived somewhere warm. We thought we'd like to live in a smaller city, so we moved this year. We felt it was time and successfully found a childcare spot for Charlotte. These are some of the more notable examples of how we've followed through on our "I will ..."s this year.

**Moving from Berlin to DÃ¼sseldorf**. [Temporarily living](https://nickang.substack.com/p/dusseldorf-first-impressions) there for 2 weeks to get a feel, deciding and starting apartment hunting, and moving to a new city in the same year.

**Finding a good new job**. I was laid off from Shopify on 14 May (receiving [this exact message](https://www.shopify.com/news/important-team-and-business-changes) as a work email on my sudden last day) and signed a new employment contract with the Fintech startup topi on 8 June. That's less than a month! It certainly felt longer when I was in the thick of it because it involved countless hours of interview prep, scheduling, and going through interviews with around 10 companies in total. But I'm happy I managed to pull it off (in a bad economy!) in under a month, and am now working in an interesting role at a [promising startup](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/hottest-startups-berlin-2023).

**Started writing daily logs for myself and my daughter**. Once in a while I'll be inspired into action by something someone on the internet is doing. This year's most impactful such-a-thing is logging. I've setup a simple text file hosted on Dropbox that I can append new log entries into with the tap of a Shortcut on my iPhone. I started doing this late in the year and have already accrued 340 entries in my log and 90 entries in my daughter's. I don't expect to know or reap the full benefits of logging like this until I've finished a full year of doing it, but so far, judging by the fact that I refer to it at least once weekly tells me that I've started something valuable. I detailed my workflow in [this post](/1-2-3-logged/).

## 2.  What did not go so well this year?

**Falsely assuming my job security**. I got laid off all of a sudden. Part of why I was so surprised was that I hadn't expected it. I could have been a little more stoic about it, preparing for the worst. But I just assumed that software engineers would be one of the last to be let go in a tech company. That turned out to be an invalid assumption. I [reflected](https://nickang.substack.com/p/reflections-on-being-laid-off-5-lessons) on this soon after the fact.

**Foresaking new projects before completion**. I created a visual web project a day and stopped at 40/70. I aimed to write [1 thought per day](https://nickang.substack.com/p/1tpd1-the-time-gap-between-idea-and) as a newsletter post and got to 14/30. I think I have a problem with finishing what I start. Funnily this doesn't happen at work, just with my side projects. Part of me thinks this is not a problem and is in fact the way I should expect these projects to play out - I'm throwing things and seeing what sticks! But another part of me thinks that I always stop throwing soon after feeling the onset of fatigue.

**Knowing, then not knowing work's place in my life**. Before being laid off, I [reflected](https://nickang.substack.com/p/the-meaning-in-your-job-beyond-the) that work is meaningful first and foremost because it allowed us to pay our bills.

After rebounding from being laid off, I made a personal vow to keep work strictly professional. That meant working for work's sake and pulling off my professional duties but not sinking any more time than necessary into it.

But one of my new managers is indirectly helping me reconsider this stance, and re-reading the enthusiasm about work in books like Radical Candor is maaking me unsure again. We do, like it or not, spend a lot of time at work after all. So I continue into 2024 uncertain of work's place in my life, trying to figure where it fits.

## 3.  What did I learn this year?
