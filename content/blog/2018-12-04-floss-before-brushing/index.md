Every time I visit the dentist I seem to learn something new. This time, I learned that you're supposed to floss _before_ you brush!

Who would have known that? Ok, maybe you did... when I heard the logic plainly explained to me, it made perfect sense.

Floss first so you dislodge the things stuck between your teeth. Then, brushing with toothpaste can provide protection to those areas.

It's so simple, yet I'd never even considered before, and have always been brushing them flossing.

Moral of the story? Who knows how many more things I'm doing wrong in my day to day adult life. Probably a lot. So I'll commit to being more humble in general, because I know less than I think I know.
