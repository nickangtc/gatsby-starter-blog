![rick and morty](images/rick-and-morty.png) Why the heck is Rick's skin gray?

Rick and Morty is such a endearingly weird show that I feel that I need to address it in a blog post. It's so odd that I must have went "Hahah, what the fuck?" about 10 times before the end of episode one.

By the end of the pilot, I just thought to myself that this is going to be a different kind of ride...

### Misconceptions

There are misconceptions that are probably being perpetuated (to the detriment of society) though, like:

- Hepatitis C is [_not_ benign](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/), despite how it (the monster character representing it in S01E03) attacked Hepatitis A
- The reason Pluto is no longer a planet anymore is _not_ because of a civilisation living on it that has been digging for plutonium - it apparently [doesn't even have much plutonium](http://quarksandcoffee.com/index.php/2015/07/22/is-there-mercury-the-element-on-mercury-the-planet-uranium-on-uranus-plutonium-on-pluto/), since its half-life is really short!

### Some thoughts

- Graphics are secondary to storytelling, and need not be sophisticated for a show to be funny, educational, inappropriate, and endearing
- Parallel universes can induce strong melancholy, especially if you've had to bury your dead self to take his place in one
- Cartoons as a format for adults is alive!

I know a lot of hard work must go into producing something as seemingly silly as Rick and Morty, so I just want to say to the creators of Rick and Morty, thank you.

You guys--writers, producers, animators, voice artists--are awesome. Keep doing what you're doing, please! If only just so that people like us can have a reason to say, _rubba-dubba-dub-dub!_
