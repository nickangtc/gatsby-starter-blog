In a bid to understand what I've been thinking about and have done for the year, I'm taking stock of the posts I've published this year.

Here are some stats (bracketed is number from 2017):

- **Posts published**: 130 (96)
- **Views**: 77,800 (5,500)
- **Visitors**: 64,300 (3,500)

Overall, I'm quite happy knowing that people are finding this blog more useful this year than last (proxied by view count). Views increased by 14 times and visitors by 18 times! These are partially vanity metrics and, in all honesty, I don't really keep track of it until the end of the year. But it does indicate that at least some of the things I've been writing resonates with some of you, which makes me feel warm inside. :)
