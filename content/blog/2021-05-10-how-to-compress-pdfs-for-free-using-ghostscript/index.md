I recently had to submit an online government form that limited file size uploads of supporting documents to 3 MB. By the time I was done compiling my documents, it was 12 MB, well over that limit.

Naturally, looked for solutions to compress the documents! But I didn't want to use an online tool for privacy and security reasons. I was trying to upload sensitive medical documents to the government.

With some googling, I found the solution that involved running two Terminal commands to compress a file. I followed a simple tutorial by [Greg Pittman](https://opensource.com/article/20/8/reduce-pdf):

```
pdf2ps -dLanguageLevel=3 viral_test_results.pdf

ps2pdf -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook viral_test_results.ps
```

With these settings, I managed to reduce my PDF by around 30-50% without a visible drop in quality.

Those commands -- `pdf2ps` and `ps2pdf` -- are part of Ghostscript. What is [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/), though, and how do you get it? Greg's tutorial hadn't mentioned that.

To get Ghostscript for your computer, if you are using macOS, you can use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/). I learned that from [VikingOSX's answer](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8584571) on the Apple forums:

```
brew update
brew upgrade
brew install ghostscript
brew cleanup
```

If you are using Windows, you can download the program directly from Ghostscript's [downloads](https://www.ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html) page. The command line commands may differ from the above.

Careful: The command may overwrite files. Consider making a copy of your file before running commands on it just in case something goes wrong!
