There's a special breed of workers called the weekend warriors.

They don't necessarily hate their jobs, although many do. Some might just be in need of a break.

Weekend warriors look forward to the end of the week. No, that's not Saturday. It's Friday.

Friday. When the work uniform is still on and feels perfect for a night out. Dressed up for free.

Drinks, food, chatter, and laughter. It feels right, and it feels earned.

But life is more than just two days a week.

We ought to make the other five feel right. Lest we forget, we already sleep about half of it away.

Earn it.
