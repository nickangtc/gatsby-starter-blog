Right now I'm just sitting here searching my mind for thoughts, including those I've had throughout the day (if I was mindful enough to notice them) and new ones as they emerge. So far, nothing.

Chasing inspiration is like trying to look at an eye floater directly, the more you try to look for it the further away and more elusive it becomes.

Perhaps it's because today is a Saturday that I don't really have any interesting thoughts to unpack and expound on.

This makes me wonder how daily bloggers like [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/), [Jonas Ellison](https://medium.com/@jonasellison) and [John Saddington](https://john.do/) do it every single day for years. Where do they find all these things to write about?

Actually, don't answer that. I don't think I'm ready for it. Benjamin Franklin may have already laid some hints for me when he said,

> "Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing."
> <cite>Benjamin Franklin, US President</cite>

I dislike lack of focus like this post clearly is, but I reject my lazy mind's plea to make today a holiday. I'm trying to learn to show up to the blank page every day like it is a duty - I'd like if no exceptions were thrown!
