It's that kind of a day again. My eyes have been drained of moisture from staying open for the greater half of a day at work and now I'm home, brain still chugging along, but I have eye strain.

On days like this I tend not to write. In spite of having an opinion or learning that I'd like crystallised in words. It's just extremely uncomfortable.

On days like this, I wished my first startup hadn't failed. That I'd have a decent typing device that would be light on my eyes, yet as convenient as writing directly on a markdown text processor or even Wordpress.

How many articles have not sprung to life because of eye strain, I have no heart to count! It's in the region of hundreds, I think.
