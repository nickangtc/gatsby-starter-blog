I just ordered a projector screen from Amazon and wanted to make a note of my good intention with it: I want to watch TV less habitually by moving my projector TV out of my bedroom and into the living room. The missing piece is a backdrop to project onto.

It cost â‚¬123,66, which feels a little excessive, but if it successfully adds friction to ~our~ my TV habit while simultaneously letting us enjoy a good movie night once in a while, I'd say it's worth it.

For the record, I was inspired to do this from Atomic Habits as one of the onetime actions that lock in good habits:

> Remove your television from your bedroom.

Did it work out?
