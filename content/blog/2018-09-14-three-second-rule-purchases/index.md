Here's my version of the three second rule applied to purchases: if something puts a smile on your face for three seconds or more, and it's something money can buy, spend and buy it.

Because if something manages to make you smile genuinely for three good seconds, it's a blue moon object that you'd be foolish to not exchange money for.

My wife and I found this watermelon plushie sitting on the counter of a parenthood store. We're not parents but that's not the point of this post anyway.

She spotted it and went, "Oh my god!" and soon after when the visual registered in my brain, I let out a similar exclamation. This, and seeing the smile on Mei's face, I immediately took out my wallet and bought it. The $50 price tag made this little wellspring of happiness a bargain.

Little moments of happiness can't be bought. Except on the few occasions like this!

**EDIT**: I was just continuing to watch the incredible Joe Rogan interview with Elon Musk and heard him bring up the same idea I was trying to encapsulate in this post.

> How many things can you buy that you really love, that really gives you joy? So rare, so rare. I wish there were more things.
