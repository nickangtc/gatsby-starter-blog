A bug. That’s what we call the bits of our code that don’t work as we, the programmer, intend. When a programme is “buggy” it means it works some times and doesn’t at others. There can be all kinds of ramifications when a company puts a buggy (software) product on the market, from loss of trust to annihilation of the business. If a tool is more cumbersome to use than to live without, all basis for using it—we’re not even talking about paying for it—is gone. Poof, in an instant.

To get good at debugging, a beginner programmer should spend some time with herself before enrolling in any in-person classes. Being stuck alone is the only thing harder than being stuck, and it’s also the constrain that spawns independence and resourcefulness. We’re already lucky to have access to the internet and google.

If you're thinking of taking the first step to independently studying programming, I highly recommend [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com). That's how I learned the hard way - I'm happy I did. Best part? It's completely free.
