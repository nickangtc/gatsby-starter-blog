## No pasa nada

Means no problem.

If a person knocks over some crates in your shop and you want to reassure them that it's not a problem, you'd say no pasa nada.

I learned this by asking my friend (while we were hiking at _La Rosandra_) how I could express myself in a situation where I needed to assure someone that it's not a problem.

No pasa nada is different from de nada, which also means no problem, but more in the sense of "don't mention it" or "you're welcome."

## Pollón

This one means big dick, or well-endowed.

I was walking with my friend to his apartment when he was trying to tell me something about a chicken. He pauses for a moment and says, "I almost said the wrong word."

I press him, "what was that word?!"

"I wanted to say pollos, which means chicken, but almost said pollón, which means big dick."

I ChatGPT-ed to clarify use: it's not meant to be an insult, like what a big asshole. It's a compliment or humorous exaggeration/tease.

## Japón

This means Japan.

Saw this on a poster in a climbing gym. It was advertising a tour package to 7 cities in Japan over 14 days that cost 3000 EUR.

A few days later I heard the local barber say this when he asked me where I'm from.

## Langostinos

Means prawns.

I'm at Carrefour when I said to the fishmonger that I wanted 'gambas' (what I learned to mean prawns, from eating plenty of tapas).

She leads me to the section with prawns and asks what I make out to mean "which _langostinos_ do you want?"

Later I asked my friend if there's a difference between gambas and langostinos, and he said maybe in anatomy of the animal, but most people don't differentiate them. Perhaps except among fishmongers.

## La niña, el niño

Means girl and boy.

The female barber at the barbershop who ended up cutting our daughter's hair took one look at Charlotte and refers to her as "el niño."

I learned the words 'el niño' and 'la niña' over a decade ago from geography. Understanding that the barber thought my daughter was a boy, I turn to her with a knowing smile and say, "la niña."

"La niña!? Ohhhhhhh!"

## Mantequilla de Cacahuetes

This means peanut butter.

We brought peanut butter as a gift to my friend's parents, who had hosted us on their beautiful terrace with chicken croquetas, tortilla de patatas, and wine from a cousin's vineyard.

Later that day, my friend's mum asked him to open the mantequilla de cacahuetes to make a snack for her granddaughter.

## La cuenta

Means the bill.

I learned this 2 years ago and forgot, but it quickly came back when we dined at a restaurant and did the gesture to our waiter for the bill.

"La cuenta?"

"Sí, por favor!"

## Tortilla de patatas

Means potato omelette.

Tortilla in Spain is not a flat round bread for making wraps. They are thick omelettes with potatoes in them.

Oh and there are two camps in Spain: tortilla de patatas eaters who think they should have onions in them, and those who don't.

My friend's family is divided right in the middle: mother and son without onions, father and daughter with onions.

## Dulce

Means sweet and the "ce" is pronounced as 'th-eh' not 'cheh'.

I first said the wrong thing in a voice message to my friend who asked us to meet him in Aguadulce ('sweet water').

We were on the beach of Aguadulce when I heard him pronounce it the right way. A beautiful name.

## Almería

I don't know what this means other than being the name of a city. But I learned from my Italian colleague who lives in Spain how to pronounce it right. It should be 'al-meh-ree-a' (long 'i') and not 'al-meh-ria'.
