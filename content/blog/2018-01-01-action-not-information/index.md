I was struggling quite a lot today with an algorithm challenge on LeetCode called "[Generate Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/description/)". It was hard enough that after trying for 2 hours, I decided it'd be for the better to look for solutions and learn from them.

But the solution I found, which was good, was not easy to understand at all! As you can imagine, I felt pretty dumb; here I was, admitting defeat and looking at the solution, and I couldn't even understand _that_!

Ok, I did understand it in the end, but only after I put my self-loathing aside and focused on breaking down the recursive algorithm staring at my face. There, I suddenly recalled a great quote from [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/) that I'd heard on the Tim Ferriss Show podcast:

> “If \[more\] information was the answer, then we’d all be billionaires with perfect abs.” - [Derek Sivers](https://tim.blog/2016/11/21/tools-of-titans-derek-sivers-distilled/)

Information is useless until we sit down and make an effort to make sense of it. The key to crossing the chasm is action, not information.
