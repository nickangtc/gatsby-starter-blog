I joined Smartly.io as a Service Operations Engineer close to 2 years ago. One of the first impactful things I did was to establish an in-house web development bootcamp that I coined the "Tech AM Bootcamp" (AM = Account Manager). I ran the first iteration with 6 participants from our Asia Pacific offices in February 2019 and today, I just concluded the second iteration of the bootcamp that started in February 2020, this time with our European offices.

In this post I document what I learned from teaching colleagues how to code, fresh from my mind as I come out of that last video call.

## On the power dynamics of teaching colleagues

Two years ago when I pitched this bootcamp internally, I was most worried about stepping on my colleagues' tails or inadvertently making them feel stupid. But this turned out to not be a problem at all. Your mileage may vary because this is largely dependent on the culture at your company. 

For me, it was easy to assume a temporary instructor identity because I work in a company that treasures learning. We costantly ensure we have a **safe** environment for people to learn, and to learn we usually need teachers. I am very glad that I work with a bunch of people who are humble and want to learn, and the where the leadership team continues to emphasise its importance. It's not something that can be said for all companies.

## In-house technical bootcamps are highly valuable

This is high-value work, because the colleagues I taught were mostly customer-facing and they already have a clear understanding of what pains our customers face most acutely and therefore they have project ideas in abundance. What they lacked, until now, were the tools to implement those projects.

Maybe it is a little weird for me to say this, but one takeaway here for technology-powered businesses is perhaps that if they come across technical people who can teach, they should try their best to attract them. Teachers can help a business in many important ways; they enable salespeople to convert more sales, account managers to keep existing customers happy, and contribute to retaining employees internally.

## On teaching online remotely

- Remote teaching was not difficult! I expected it to be challenging, but when you *level the playing field* by making everyone participate remotely, most of the remote-related challenges  melt away
- Tried doing "everyone's mics are on" but that didn't help too much -> what helped a lot was changing from headphones to earphones to feel less isolated

- Tips for conducting high-quality, enjoyable online classes 
- Change the scaling of your monitor to have everything slightly bigger (like what your grandfather might set on his personal laptop) -> it helps participants more clearly see what you have on the screen
- The world is still learning the dynamics of online calls, so lay your expectations as ground rules at the beginning of the call (e.g. "I won't be able to see you I don't have a second screen, so please make some sound if you want to say something any time.")

## On ability to teach technical concepts

- When it comes to teaching, 70 percent of the battle is already won if you have students who are self-motivated to learn what you are going to teach. The others are 10 percent encouragement and 20 percent instructional quality

- My ability to teach the same topic has improved significantly since the last time I taught it. I explain concepts more clearly because I remember (surprisingly) the foibles from the last time I taught it to a group of people. By now I've taught the basics of JavaScript programming more than 5 times to strangers and to colleagues and I can recall all the times when some way of explaining a concept flopped. It's probably a mix of wanting to avoid embarrassment and a genuine desire to want to get the message across clearly.
