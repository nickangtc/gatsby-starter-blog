title: "Reflecting on my 3-week work rotation in Helsinki"
date: "2019-02-09"

I recently spent three weeks in Helsinki as a sort of mini-rotation within [Smartly.io](https://smartly.io). While I was there, I worked a lot more closely with the team I belong to but have been working remotely with from Singapore, and I’ve learned a lot.

Below are some of my main learnings, which appear in no particular order. I was bored on my flight home to Singapore and made a couple of sketches to accompany some of the points. Happy reading!

## There's no need to run

![walking in office and not running nick ang blog](images/walking-in-office-and-not-running-nick-ang-blog-1024x1024.png)

No need to rush, one thing at a time mentality of Finnish colleagues. I want to emulate. First, by stopping my habit of running in a small office.

## Work hard, then go home on time and live

Working on laptop picture

When I'm overseas I tend to work more. There were a few evenings where I left the office at 9pm instead of the usual 6pm. The main reason is the fact that I'm alone in the city. There's only so many activities to do before you've done them all. The funny thing is, I realised that no matter how much work I do, there's always more work that can be done. Experiencing this voluntary "overworking" really drove home this point for me. Work on what you can to deliver the most impact, and then go home and have a nice evening to relax and live.

## Done is better than perfect

![ugly snowman vs snowball nick ang blog](images/ugly-snowman-vs-snowball-nick-ang-blog-1024x1024.png)

In a startup, before attaining stability and dominating a space, the idea of “done is better than perfect" or "speed as a habit" is useful to internalise and embody.

Get it done, then go back and do it well. But produce the benefits as soon as possible. I witnessed this at work in the way one colleague hacked a bookmarklet that enhances people’s experience when they are doing customer support, and the way another coworker scoped a new internal tool project, stripping it of "nice to haves" down to the bare essentials so that people can start using it as soon as possible.

## Trust is built 100x faster in person than on video calls

I had known for a long time that trust is built socially, and that it is built much more effectively in person. But this trip made me realise just _how much_ more effective. By my estimation, it’s something like 100 times.

Now that I’ve been back for a couple of days and have joined video calls with my colleagues on the other side of the world once again, I’ve noticed a change in the fluidity of our conversations. We crack more jokes and show more concern for one another’s wellbeing. All of this adds up to a better working experience.

I’m also much more comfortable asking for help and openly discussing ideas with them via Flowdock (what we use as our internal messaging platform). This is fantastic, because it helps me make better decisions and carry out my work faster!

## Smart people aren’t afraid to look like they don’t know

![confidence nick ang blog](images/confidence-nick-ang-blog-1024x1024.png)

There is truly nothing to be embarrassed about when you don’t know something. You should only feel embarrassed if you allow yourself to continue not knowing even when you know that it is something important to learn. A coworker who is in a similar role as I am asked me a question that only someone who is earnest to learn would ask, because it was a technical question that some would expect him to already know. I thought he did himself a favour by not feeling too embarrassed to ask.

## It’s healthy to seek achievements outside of work

Having an intense hobby outside of work is good for your physical health but also your mental health, because it reduces the chance of you connecting too much of your self worth to your work. I've noticed a few of my colleagues here are into skiing, rock climbing and bouldering, soccer, swimming, triathlons. I wrote a whole [post](tk) on this.

## Induction technology is a life hack

Induction stoves are amazingly effective at heating up stuff in a pot. If there are not many drawbacks, I'd fit my future kitchen with induction stoves and cookware!

## Husky sledding occupy an uncomfortable space in my mind

Husky sledding is a grey area for me and I'm not sure yet how to think about it. From what I observe in Lapland, Finland, people who care for and lead packs of huskies are very kind people, but I still feel apprehensive about making them do the work of pulling the sled's and my weight because it seems to be a burden on these fantastic animals. It also feels a little exploitative, somehow more intensely than when a farmer ploughs the field with an ox or a person rides a horse.

## Goodbyes are hard and I prefer not doing it

I'm bad at goodbyes and prefer to avoid them altogether if I could. On my last day in our Helsinki office, I didn't walk around the office to say bye to everyone that I actually felt like saying bye to. I find goodbyes awkward. It always feels like I'm fishing for some last minute love, until next time.

So whenever I can help it, I don’t do it. I prefer a silent exit.

## Daily-ish reflections on Instagram

Throughout my trip, I also wrote my reflections and published them periodically on my Instagram account. It was meant to be an experiment and at the end, I'd say I had a pleasant experience writing reflections there.

The only problem is that I don't really have control over whether Instagram servers are going to be kept alive in the next 50 years, whereas I can be confident that I can spin up another server myself that hosts WordPress (which is open-sourced) if the server for this blog dies tomorrow.

But this post isn't meant to be a reflection about data ownership, so let's move right along to the (select set of) Instagram posts...

> [Seeing falling snow for the first time Based on my poor memory, today is my first time experiencing fresh falling snow. It's kind of a big deal. Beautiful snowflake shape isn't a myth! ❄️ We asked some hard questions today around strategy and vision of the company. Started 5 years ago, @smartlyio has grown a lot. But growth requires fuel, and when you recognise you need a top up, you don't just keep your foot on the pedal and go full speed ahead. You pull over, cut the engine, and think about the best option you have that gives you the best possible chance of making it to where you're trying to go. In terms of culture, one thing I witnessed today that I really liked was when our COO Anssi told us, after his 30 minutes presentation on concrete tactical steps on executing our strategy, that he had to go home. He wasn't going to stay the whole week with us here m, as much as he wanted to hang around and get drunk with the 100 new people we've since hired to join the team. Why? Because he just had a newborn and he puts family as #1, and he's got diaper duties. In my opinion, this is what it should be like working in a company. We're a pro team. But even pro teams give way to family, and personal well-being that may result from that. I love that this is clear here. On a lighter side, we had a game of bowling today that we didn't manage to finish before the alley closed. Then most of us made our way to the fireside stories of how different people, young or old in the company, went through the interview process, experienced awkwardness and other things that got them to where they are now in their careers. From what I hear, it's extreme transparency and playing hard at its finest :) I didn't attend it (because I already had at our regional offsite) and instead decided to spend time with some individual people whom I admire, respect, and want to learn about and from. It was a good night. Wine glass count: 3. Long drink count: 1. Level of drunkenness: 6. Joy level: 9! #companyculture #snow #conversations](https://www.instagram.com/p/BsZUc5XBpa9/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_medium=loading)

> [As excited as a Finn can get Windows 95 man is a revelation. Look at those moves! He was on fire 🔥 maybe because it was a Finnish song. A lot has happened in the last few days and I haven't written about them because I've been busy (and tired) from all the good conversations, work, and partying. In these moments, my approach is to be present instead of documenting. It's been great though. Futurio H1 2019 is now officially over. Company strategy has been adjusted, questions have been raised and answered, and we're now ready to move 300+ people towards achieving the company's goals. Now it's all about execution 🤠 Yesterday we went rock climbing and bumped into a colleague there (Helsinki is so small) and he showed us his mad skills at bouldering. I'm really beginning to enjoy the sport a lot. It's a mental, physical and technical challenge every single time. It builds grit above all - highly recommended! Oh and we went for Nepalese dinner afterwards with his girlfriend and twin brother. It was a simple and wonderful evening 🙂 #companyculture #helsinki #dj #reflection](https://www.instagram.com/p/BskjhqABnvG/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_medium=loading)

> [There's chicken in this, is that ok for you? I just realised that I’m back in the place where my experiment to be a vegetarian started! It’s really easy to be vegetarian/vegan in Helsinki, because almost every restaurant has a good non-meat selection to choose from. There's even an item called McVegan in the McDonald's here! Although I'm a little disappointed they don't have Filet-O-Fish here in Finland. Today for lunch, I was getting Chinese food and pointed to some curry dish that looked like curry vegetables. Without me mentioning that I was vegetarian, the lady behind the counter asked, “There’s chicken in this, is that ok for you?” Her question took me so much by surprise that it must have been a good 4-5 seconds before I responded. There’s probably so many vege/vegan eaters here that it’s become second nature to ask. How wonderful. In the office today, we had to reject a candidate whom we believed wasn’t strong enough to be what we like to call an “elevating hire”. This was after giving ourselves a day after the 3rd stage interview to mull over the decision. Once we’ve decided, we could have chosen to send an email to reject the candidate, but instead, my team lead insisted that we should hop on a call to deliver the news because it’s the right thing to do. This to me is another clear embodiment of what I like to call a “humanist culture” that we have at @smartlyio. Do the right thing, no matter how painful it is. After work, Khairil, Peter, Marinella and I went bouldering at Kiipeilyareena Kalasatama. I’m starting to really enjoy climbing, be it on ropes or bouldering, because it is a challenge every time. It pushes me to try my best to get to the last hold. Everything is constant when climbing since the rock holds don’t move - the only change that spells the difference between making it to the top and not is strength, technique, and tenacity. I love how clear the path to success is (at least at my level) and I thoroughly enjoy the pain because I know the next time I face the same problem, I’ll be stronger and readier to face it :) #reflection #companyculture #rockclimbing #bouldering #helsinki](https://www.instagram.com/p/BsyphbiBQG2/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_medium=loading)

> [Tallinn, Estonia We spent the weekend in Tallinn, a beautiful city that's a 2.5 hour ship ride from Helsinki. I think we were mesmerised more by the white landscape than we were the culture, because we had magical weather the whole weekend! I don't know what it's called, but sliding down snow slopes is a ton of fun. It has been 29 years in the making and even though we could only do it a few times before the plastic slide thingy we found broke even further, it's something I'll remember for a long time. No wonder the kids were still at it after an hour 😄 Tallinn itself is quite a picturesque city. Cobblestone streets and consistent pastel-painted buildings from the medieval times. These have been standing for several hundred years, which is surprising considering how many different countries took over control of Estonia in much of its history (Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Russia, Soviet Union). There's now a part of the city called Tallinn Old Town, which is a UNESCO world heritage site. It's a really nice town. Fun fact, Skype (the software) was created by Estonians and close to 50 percent of the company's employees (part of Microsoft now) are still based in Tallinn and Tartu, Estonia 🇪🇪 not bad for a country that has been independent most recently since 1991, I'd say! #reflection #tallinn #snow](https://www.instagram.com/p/BtJxgujBr5S/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_medium=loading)

> [We ignored Santa and made snowballs I feel like I'm on a different planet! That's what I said to @charlane\_yu when we first arrived in Rovaniemi city. The entire place is white, like that final scene in Inception. It's like nothing I had ever seen. Following that was just disbelief that 60,000 people actually live here, like our host. She was really, really hospitable. So we went to Santa Claus Village today and walked around the vicinity. Apparently we crossed the Arctic Circle line multiple times, though no superpowers were gained. Oh and when we found where Santa was (he was sitting in a photography studio with a line of children and overaged kids waiting outside), we just turned around and headed out. "Tourist trap" was what I think I said. 😀 you're welcome, "Santa"! 🎅 What I found really enjoyable was interacting and petting the huskies. 🐕 Mei and I felt their plight, though maybe they could, by some twist of logic, be pretty happy waiting to pull tourists on sleds. In the Husky park where they're resting, Mei and I stroked them and looked them in their gorgeous blue eyes. Such wonderful souls these dogs are 😊 Oh and I made my first snowball today. ⛄️ It took an hour of work to get the ball to a decent size, but I was really proud of myself because the snow was fluffy and unsuitable for making balls, but with a bit of ingenuity (water from a bottle), I made one the size of my head :D but then it got too cold and under Mei's persuasion, I tucked it next to a tree near Santa's main office and we left. #reflection #traveling #rovaniemi](https://www.instagram.com/p/BtSYzsBBwjz/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_medium=loading)
