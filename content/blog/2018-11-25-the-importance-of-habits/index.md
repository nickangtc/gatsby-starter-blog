Here's a fantastic animated film about habits that was recently recommended in my YouTube feed.

This got me thinking about my own struggle with habits.

Habits that I have that I'm proud of:

- Working out 3 times a week
- Writing and publishing a blog post daily
- Brushing twice and flossing daily

The bad habits that I want to kick:

- Checking WhatsApp, Instagram, and email first thing when I wake up
- Not planning for a nutritious meal ahead of time and defaulting to trashy food like McDonald's whenever I'm hungry
- Using my phone whenever in I'm in the toilet for #2 - I'd rather be doing nothing or if something, be reading a book

And, habits I'm aspiring to form:

- Meditating daily
- Doing some kind of marketing for [ang veil yu](https://angveilyu.com) daily

Just taking stock of the habits I have and want in life because I wholeheartedly believe that all we need are three to five great habits to have a healthy and fulfilling life.
