One very common scenario for wanting to clone a class instance is inside a function.

### Why there's a need to clone objects/arrays inside functions

Because non-primitive data structures are passed by reference in JavaScript, we will inadvertently mutate the original object or array passed into a function as an argument. Here's a quick illustration of this behaviour:

var userJohn = {
  firstName: 'john',
  lastName: 'campbell',
  dob: '01/01/1987',
  accountNumber: '12345678'
};

function maskSensitiveInfo (user) {
  var sensitiveFields = \['dob', 'accountNumber'\];

  sensitiveFields.forEach(function (field) {
    user\[field\] = 'hidden';
  });

  return user;
}

var userJohnMasked = maskSensitiveInfo(userJohn);
console.log(userJohnMasked === userJohn);  // we expect this to be false, but it is true!

In the above, `userJohn` was mutated inside the `maskSensitiveInfo()` function. Specifically, the line `user[field] = 'hidden';` mutates `userJohn` _directly_ instead of mutating a copy of it.

This behaviour is expected for non-primitive data types; that is, any variables that hold a data type other than the 6 primitives (boolean, number, string, symbol, null, and undefined).

I think it's also the reason why many JavaScript code style guides I've come across so far recommend not mutating arguments within functions. [Airbnb's](http://airbnb.io/javascript/#functions--mutate-params) style guide is an example.

### How to shallow copy an object

Instead, they recommend creating a copy of any object/array inside functions - basically as a preventive measure to eliminate the potential for unwanted (and hard to trace) side effects caused by mutating something outside of the function from within.

function maskSensitiveInfo (user) {
  var userClone = Object.assign({}, user);
  var sensitiveFields = \['dob', 'accountNumber'\];

  sensitiveFields.forEach(function (field) {
    userClone\[field\] = 'hidden';
  });

  return userClone;
}

var userJohnMasked = maskSensitiveInfo(userJohn);
console.log(userJohnMasked === userJohn);  // correctly false!

In the above snippet, the `maskSensitiveInfo()` function now creates a copy of the `user` object being passed in and uses it for intermediate steps that mutate it, before returning it. That's why `userJohnMasked` is no longer the same object as `userJohn` (ie. `userJohnMasked === userJohn` evaluates to false).

### Caveat for shallow copy: only one level deep

What we've just seen is _shallow copying_. It's so-called "shallow" because `Object.assign()` is only going to copy over the first-level values and assign that to a new object. If, for example, `userJohn` has a key called "account" and its value is another object, that object is _not_ copied but is once again only _referenced_.

This snippet illustrates the point:

var userJohn = {
  firstName: 'john',
  lastName: 'campbell',
  dob: '01/01/1987',
  accountNumber: '12345678',
  account: {
    number: '12345678',
    type: 'savings'
  }
};

function maskSensitiveInfo (user) {
  var userClone = Object.assign({}, user);
  var sensitiveFields = \['dob', 'accountNumber'\];

  sensitiveFields.forEach(function (field) {
    userClone\[field\] = 'hidden';
  });

  userClone.account.number = 'hidden';
  userClone.account.type = 'hidden';

  return userClone;
}

var userJohnMasked = maskSensitiveInfo(userJohn);
console.log(userJohnMasked.account.number);  // 'hidden'
console.log(userJohn.account.number);  // we expect to be '12345678' but it is 'hidden'

The original object, `userJohn`, is accidentally mutated by the line `userClone.account.number = 'hidden'`. This is one of those horrible bugs that can be really hard to pinpoint.

To do a deep copy (vis-a-vis shallow copy), it's best to use an external library like jQuery or Lodash:

// jQuery method
var newObject = jQuery.extend(true, {}, oldObject);

// lodash method 
var deep = \_.cloneDeep(objects);

More details on deep cloning can be found in [this SO thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/122102/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-to-deep-clone-an-object-in-javascript).

So that's how you shallow/deep clone objects created from using the object literal syntax `var x = {};` or `var x = Object.create();`, meaning they are literally constructed directly from the Object class in JavaScript.

What about objects that are **instances of a custom implemented class**? As we'll see, because we will most likely have methods implemented on custom classes, the methods above will not suffice - the instance methods will not be copied over!

### Cloning a class instance including its methods

I recently found out something that wasn't obvious to me - apparently, **methods defined within a class definition are automatically added to the prototype chain** of the instance object.

So, to copy over the methods from one class instance to another, we will need to copy the prototype chain _on top of_ copying the instance variables.

Here's the magical series of built-in methods that can be used to create a copy of an instance of a custom-implemented class:

function copyInstance (original) {
  var copied = Object.assign(
    Object.create(
      Object.getPrototypeOf(original)
    ),
    original
  );
  return copied;
}

That's quite horrid syntax on first and second glance, but on third glance...

Here's how it works:

1. `Object.create()` creates a new object and `Object.getPrototypeOf()` gets the prototype chain of the `original` instance and adds them to the newly created object
2. `Object.assign()` does as we've seen earlier, which is to (shallow) copy the instance variables over to the newly created object

This comes in really handy for custom-implemented classes like `Stack` or `Queue` or `LinkedList`.

However, sometimes you will need to add a few extra lines to the `copyInstance()` method, depending on whether your class has any instance variables that need to be copied as well. In my case, I had to clone an array that is stored as an instance variable called `this.stack` within the Stack implementation:

this.stack = \[3, 2, 5, 4, 1\];

// clone stack using .slice()
this.clonedStack = this.stack.slice(0);

Here's the use case I recently had with a Stack (it uses ES6, so in case you're unfamiliar, just treat all `const` and `let` as `var`s):

// modified copyInstance method that works specifically for my Stack class
function copyInstanceStack (original) {
  var copied = Object.assign(
    Object.create(
      Object.getPrototypeOf(original)
    ),
    original
  );

  // CREATE SHALLOW COPY OF INSTANCE VARIABLE
  copied.stack = copied.stack.slice(0);

  return copied;
}

// custom implemented Stack data structure
class Stack {
  constructor () {
    // THIS NEEDS TO COPIED
    this.stack = \[\];
  }

  // ALL THESE METHODS NEED TO BE COPIED AS WELL
  push (data) {
    const newNode = new Node(data);
    const index = this.stack.length;

    if (this.stack.length === 0) newNode.minIndex = 0;
    else {
      const prevMinIndex = this.stack\[index - 1\].minIndex;
      const val = this.stack\[prevMinIndex\].data;
      newNode.minIndex = data < val ? index : prevMinIndex;
    }
    this.stack.push(newNode);
  }

  pop () {
    return this.stack.pop();
  }

  min () {
    if (this.stack.length === 0) return null;
    const minIndex = this.peek().minIndex;
    return this.stack\[minIndex\].data;
  }

  peek () {
    if (this.stack.length === 0) return null;
    return this.stack\[this.stack.length - 1\];
  }

  isEmpty () {
    if (this.stack.length === 0) return true;
    return false;
  }
}

// standalone function that sorts a stack instance
function sortStack (stack) {
  // MAKE COPY TO PREVENT DIRECT MUTATION OF ORIGINAL STACK  INSTANCE
  let unsorted = copyInstanceStack(stack);
  let sorted = new Stack();

  // ignore the details, including for completeness...
  while (!unsorted.isEmpty()) {
    let current = unsorted.pop().data;
    let placed = false;

    while (!placed) {
      if (sorted.isEmpty() || sorted.peek().data >= current) {
        sorted.push(current);
        placed = true;
      } else {
        unsorted.push(sorted.pop().data);
      }
    }
  }
  return sorted;
}

let s1 = new Stack();
s1.push(4);
s1.push(2);
s1.push(3);
s1.push(6);
s1.push(5);
s1.push(1);

let s2 = sortStack(s1);
console.log(s2);  // sorted stack order
console.log(s1);  // original stack order (ie. not mutated, yay!)

### Summary

I didn't intend for this post to get so long, but I wanted to be complete with my examples because I know it's important contextual information for wrapping your head around the idea of cloning.

Here's a summary to make it easier:

- Non-primitive data types like Objects and Arrays are passed by reference into functions, unlike for primitives which are passed by value
- Passed by reference implies that if a function mutates or reassigns an argument that is an object or array, the original variable _outside_ of the function also gets mutated/reassigned - this can become a nasty, hard to uncover bug
- For the above reasons, Airbnb, among other companies, eschew direct mutation or reassignment of arguments within functions
- The solution is to create a clone before working with the cloned variable inside the function to prevent side effects
- There are two types of cloning: shallow and deep
- Shallow only clones one layer deep, which means if any key-value pair in an object contains another object, or if an object is stored as an item in an array, those continue to be _references_ instead of cloned values
- Deep cloning accounts for nested objects by effectively creating copies recursively until the deepest layer, ensuring there are no connected references to the original object
- To clone an instance of a custom-implemented class, including its custom-implemented methods within the class, you need to copy over the prototype chain (because methods defined inside a class are added to the prototype chain) as well as the instance variables

I'm mainly writing this to ensure I have a note on this esoteric but essential part of JavaScript, but I certainly hope it was helpful to you in some way too!
