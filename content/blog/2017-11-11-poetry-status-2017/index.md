It's almost the end of the year 2017. I'm 27 and I still don't get poetry.

I'm inspired to log this here after trying to understand the poem Elon Musk recently [shared](https://www.instagram.com/p/BaakbPEA4q6/?taken-by=elonmusk) on his Instagram account.

Hopeful that one day I'll get a poem and happily go down that rabbit hole.
