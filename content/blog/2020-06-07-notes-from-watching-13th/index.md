The documentary is very well made and provides someone like me with the important specifics of the history of black people's struggles in the US.

Quote blocks below are my quick notes when watching the documentary. Words below the quotes are my thoughts on them in post-processing.

> After the 13th amendment abolished slavery in the US, southern states (where most last remaining pro-slave people were) needed to do something to regain their production again to rebuild the economy. 4 million negroes who were previously property had suddenly become citizens and it was a problem.

> Public lynching and other acts of terrorism on negroes happened regularly. At some point, American society no longer wanted these public acts of terror on negroes and a new legal angle of attack on black people commenced.

> Nixon in 1970s declared war on drugs internally as the most important problem for the US. Most historians believe this was a proxy war against black and latino communities.

> _Cops_ and other TV shows like it tend to over-represent black people as criminals.

> "Super predators" was at one point used regularly by the media and politicians (including Hillary Clinton) to refer to the young black population.

Four young black men were accused of rape of a woman in the Central Park jogger case of 1989. DNA evidence apparently showed they were innocent, but that was after years of prison time had already been served on the erroneous accusations. Trump took out an ad in some printed medium to lobby for the death penalty for these men.

The Black Panthers was a black organisation for TK led by TK that was labelled as "the greatest threat to America" by J. Edgar Hoover (TK title).

Trayvon Martin, a 17 year-old black kid was shot and killed by a white man, George Zimmerman, just for walking in a neighbourhood to visit his relatives. Zimmerman was charged with murder but was acquitted after claiming self-defense aided by the "stand your ground" law.

> A stand-your-ground law (sometimes called "line in the sand" or "no duty to retreat" law) establishes a right by which a person may defend one's self or others (right of self-defense) against threats or perceived threats, even to the point of applying lethal force, regardless of whether safely retreating from the situation might have been possible.

That law was passed through corporations that stood to gain financially from more sale of guns, bullets, and prison inmates, who were in bed with US law-makers through the organisation called ALEC (American Legislative Exchange Council). So blatant is ALEC's involvement in the government's passing of laws that the ALEC logo had been forgotten in some proposal bill before.

Contracts from government to private prison operators. Government had to guarantee a minimum number of inmates as part of contractual agreements. Step one in creating perverse incentives for getting more bodies into prisons. Start of prison-industrial complex.

Corporations make use of prison labour as the 13th Amendment of the US Constitution allows for it: "neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for a crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_labor_in_the_United_States)).

Plea bargains vs going to trial. The legal system favours plea bargains by making sure that if you go to trial (if you can afford it) and lose the trial, your sentence will become much higher. Kalief Browder chose not to take plea bargain for his case of petty crime. He served jail time for something trivial. When he was let out, he gave some interviews. His mental health deteriorated significantly because of the ordeal and he hanged himself at age 22.

Convicted felons cannot vote. This is apparently called [felony disenfranchisement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony_disenfranchisement_in_the_United_States) in the US. (Why? Isn't that too strong a blow?) Something like 30 percent of the black population in Alabama have actually lost their rights to vote because they have had some kind of criminal record. Selma, Alabama was where Martin Luther King Jr led black marches in the 1960s.

> Who is Jim Crow? He seems so important in all of this.

Turns out, he is a fictional character in a theatre production that was used as a racist depiction of black people. I need to find out more...
