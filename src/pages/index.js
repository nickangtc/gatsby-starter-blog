      <p>I'm a guy from Singapore, currently living in Berlin. <span role="img" aria-label="hand wave emoji">ðŸ‘‹</span> </p>
      <p>This is my digital garden, where I sow new ideas, tend to the growing and matured ones, and occasionally prune the undesirable. It's open for visitation.</p>
      <p>But like a real-life garden, expect organised chaos when you <Link to="/blog">browse the blog</Link>.</p>

      <h2>Blurb</h2>
      <p>I was born in Singapore, lived there my whole life, and am currently living in Berlin, Germany. At almost 30 years old, <a href="/2020-06-01-why-i-moved-to-berlin/">making this move</a> remains one of my proudest accomplishments because I have dreamed since I was in primary school to experience life abroad. So I guess that means I am living my dream.</p>
      <p>Professionally, and I should say <em>at the moment</em>, I am a software engineer. My strengths are my ability to learn and teach. I currently work full-time as a service operations engineer at <a href="https://smartly.io">Smartly.io</a>, a Finnish ad-tech company.</p>
      <p>Iâ€™ve taught close to 100 strangers and colleagues from scratch how to code. That was my first taste of being consequential in peopleâ€™s lives. I hope to continue to be useful to people beyond the confines of my full-time employment and this site exists to help me fulfil that hope.</p>
      <p>Rapid-fire facts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I'm married and have a toy poodle Brownie who has his own <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brownie_ang/">Instagram account</a></li>
        <li>Once I tried to create a "laptop for writers" as a <a href="/2016-03-12-hardware-startup-why-shelf/">startup that failed</a>. Now I unironically write on a product created (later) by another company Astrohaus. They call it the Freewrite and I love <a href="/2019-12-15-first-impressions-of-the-astrohaus-freewrite">my Freewrite</a></li>
        <li>My major is in Environmental Studies from NUS. I don't remember 95 percent of what I learned but rely on the other 5 percent every moment to help me think about the world</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I collated some things that I would recommend, like podcasts and blogs, in the <Link to="/recommendations">Recommendations</Link> corner.</p>
      <p>So, that's my <a href="https://sive.rs/publicu">public persona</a> in brief. Send me a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=17964382&text=Hey%20Nick!">direct message on twitter</a> or <Link to="/email">email</Link> to talk!</p>
