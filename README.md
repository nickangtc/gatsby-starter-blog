This is the Gatsby source code for my blog at https://nickang.com. I started with the [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).

I made the decision to to open source my Gatsby blog so that more people can copy-paste and reference the source code of a functioning Gatsby site used as a personal blog.
